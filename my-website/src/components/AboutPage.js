          Hi my name is Shane Schmaltz. Iâ€™m a software developer from Calgary
          Alberta Canada. Welcome to my website! It was the first site I made
          with React.. I am currently re-writing it since I have learned tons
          since I first created it and it no longer showcases my current
          abilities as a Web Developer. Thanks for stopping by, please feel free
          to contact me using the contact page.
