          Hi my name is Shane Schmaltz. Iâ€™m a software developer from Calgary
          Alberta Canada. Welcome to my website! It was the first site I made
          with React.. and I am currently re-writing it. I have learned tons
          since it's first creation and it no longer showcases my abilities as a
          web developer. Thanks for stopping by, please feel free to contact me
          using the contact page.
        </span>
        <span className="about-paragraph__second" />
      </div>
